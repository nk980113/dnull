# dnull - a minimum library for your discord bot to work

node.js 20.10.0 or above is required.

This repository is very WIP.

Audio support will be added if I want to.

This repository uses [MIT License](./LICENSE).

# Get Started

[The entry point](./src/index.ts) includes a template to use this library.

Insert your token at [token.ts](./src/token.ts).

`npm start` to run the bot.

# Documentation

The code is self-explanatory. ~~Definitely not I'm too lazy to add docs~~
